# customkc

a customized keycloak container image

This project is an exmple of how to create a customized (i.e. an image with an embedded setup to access a production DB or with a company brand theme or with specific SPI providers) image of Kycloak.

In this example the external DB is a PostgresQL instance.

The example suppose you are using podman to manage the required containers, in case you are using docker commands should be the same, in case you want to deploy on kubernetes or OpenShift some additional work is required but the base concepts of creating a custom image will remain the same.

## Preparing a Pod with Postgres database

In this example we are going to use a pod with two containers, a container with the actual database server and a container with pgadmin client, a tool to administer postgresql server.

Let's start creating the pod:

    > podman pod create --name postgres -p 4080:80 -p 5432:5432

now we can run the postgresql container (version 13 for this example):

    > podman run -d --rm --name db --pod postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=admin -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -v ~/worklab/projects/volumes/pgsql_13/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data --privileged docker.io/library/postgres:13

in the previous command note that '--privileged' parameter is used to avoid issues of privileges when running in rootless mode.
The -v parameter is used give persistency to the pod through restarts.

In the pod now we deploy also the PGADMIN tool, a web interface to administer postgresql databases:

    > podman run -d --rm --name pgadmin --pod postgres -e 'PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@redhat.com' -e 'PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=password' docker.io/dpage/pgadmin4

This tool will be useful for the next quick steps we need to execute before launching the keycloak server. Open a browser and connect to http://localhost:4080 (or any other port you have specified in the previous comand *podman pod create ...*). Insert the email and password when launched the pgadmin container and access the web console.

Using the console you just need to create a server and into the server to create a database (name the database **keycloak**).

Done! The database is now ready to be used as the external configuration repository for Keycloak server.

## Build and Run the custom keycloak image

access the docker directory and execute the build with the command 

    > podman build -t custom-keycloak .

looking at the *Dockerfile* used in this example I just want to address a couple of points: we are using the multi stage build (very useful to be sure that the build will be indipendent from the environment) and at line 13 we execute the final setup/conf/custumization, remember that this phase could be performed also at deploy time but of course the deploy will be slower.

Finally we can run the customi keycloak image:

    > podman run -d --rm --name keycloak -p 8443:8443 -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password custom-keycloak start --db-url=jdbc:postgresql://<your-workstation-hostname>:5432/keycloak --db-username=admin --db-password=password --hostname=<your-workstation-hostname>:8443

access the console and start to protect applications!
